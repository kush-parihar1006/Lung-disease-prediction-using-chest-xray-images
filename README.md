# Lung-disease-prediction-using-chest-xray-images
Research based deep learning and trasnfer learning project regarding classification of multifaceted lung diseases.
The main objective of the project is to develop and train deep leaarning models such as CNN and trasfer learning models such as Resnet50 and VGG16 from scratch and use it to classify the diverse set of xray images in the form of lung diseases such as pneumonia, covid -19, cancer and normal images. This is a research based project with a dertailed comparison of all the three models with resepct to the accuracy and loss percentage.
